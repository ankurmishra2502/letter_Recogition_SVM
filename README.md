# letter_Recogition_SVM

letter recognition problem using SVMs

It contains the 26 English alphabets as classes, so it's a multiclass classification problem with 26 classes.

Each row in the data set represents an image of a handwritten alphabet. Using some basic image processing, the images are converted into m X n pixels, where m and n depend on the size and resolution of the original image. Each pixel contains numeric values, with higher values denoting the presence of dense 'ink'. In the pixels where nothing is written, the pixel value is 0.
